      This blog is a living notebook of the engineering ideas I want close at hand: how to reason about
      runtime behavior, how to test without waste, and how to keep systems simple under pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      I write for experienced developers who value clarity and practical guidance. Expect short posts with
      concrete examples and a bias toward real-world trade-offs.
