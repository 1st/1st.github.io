          Testing is a cornerstone of modern software development, ensuring that applications work as intended,
          remain reliable, and deliver a smooth user experience. Without proper testing, small coding mistakes can
          slip into production, leading to bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, or even complete
          system failures.
        </p>
        <p>
          By running different types of tests, teams can catch problems early, verify that new features do not break
          existing ones, and confirm the software meets business and user expectations. In short, testing is not just
          about finding defects. It is about building confidence in the quality of the product before it reaches the
          hands of real users.
