# Software Test Types


## 1. By Scope *(How much of the system is tested)*

| Test Type                 | What It Does                                                                   | Analogy                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unit Test**             | Tests **one small piece** of code (a function, method, or class) in isolation. | Checking if one Lego block is strong enough.             |
| **Integration Test**      | Tests **how different modules/components work together**.                      | Seeing if two Lego blocks connect properly.              |
| **System Test**           | Tests the **entire application** as a whole.                                   | Playing with the full Lego set after building it.        |
| **End-to-End (E2E) Test** | Simulates **real user flows** from start to finish, often through the UI.      | Pretending to be the customer playing with the Lego set. |

## 2. By Purpose *(Why you’re running the test)*

| Test Type              | What It Does                                                                    | Analogy                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Smoke Test**         | Quick check to see if the system basically works after changes.                 | Turning on the Lego train to see if it runs at all.                 |
| **Sanity Test**        | Narrow check to verify a **specific new change** works (less broad than smoke). | Checking if a new Lego motor works before assembling everything.    |
| **Regression Test**    | Ensures **old features still work** after changes.                              | Making sure your Lego car still moves after adding new decorations. |
| **Performance Test**   | Measures **speed, responsiveness, and stability** under load.                   | Seeing if your Lego bridge can hold 10 cars at once.                |
| **Load / Stress Test** | Tests **how the system behaves under heavy use** or extreme conditions.         | Putting 50 Lego trains on one track to see when it breaks.          |
| **Security Test**      | Checks for vulnerabilities and weaknesses.                                      | Making sure nobody can steal your Lego without you noticing.        |
| **Usability Test**     | Measures how easy it is for users to use the system.                            | Asking friends if they can build the Lego set without instructions. |

## 3. By Approach *(How tests are written & executed)*

| Test Type                             | What It Does                                                                                 | Analogy                                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**     | Write **tests first**, then write code to pass those tests.                                  | Designing a Lego challenge before you start building.          |
| **BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)** | Write tests in **plain language** (often using Given-When-Then format) to describe behavior. | Agreeing with friends what the Lego should do before building. |
| **Manual Testing**                    | Human testers click/type/use the app to find issues.                                         | You play with the Lego yourself.                               |
| **Automated Testing**                 | Scripts/programs run tests automatically.                                                    | A robot builds and tests the Lego set for you.                 |

## 4. Special Types

| Test Type              | What It Does                                                                   | Analogy                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Acceptance Test**    | Confirms the system meets **business requirements** (often done with clients). | Checking if the Lego set matches the picture on the box.  |
| **Exploratory Test**   | Tester freely explores without a strict plan to find issues.                   | Just playing around with the Lego set to see what breaks. |
| **Compatibility Test** | Checks if the system works on **different devices, OS, browsers**.             | Seeing if the Lego car runs on all kinds of tracks.       |

✅ **Tip for remembering:**

* **Scope** = How big the test is (unit → integration → system → E2E)
* **Purpose** = Why you’re running it (smoke, regression, performance, security…)
* **Approach** = How you write/run it (TDD, BDD, manual, automated)
